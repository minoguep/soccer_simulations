# Soccer simulations

A repo containing some initial exploratory analysis on how I can use poisson regression to simulate League of Ireland matches. Feel free to use the notebook for your own analysis. I plan to expand on the analysis performed here in a future blog post on [my website](https://paulminogue.com/), so keep an eye out there if you're interested.
